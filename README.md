# 2D Minecraft

Have you ever wanted to play minecraft but 2D? Here you have it!

Play a unique minecraft experience with a 3 blocks wide world and a locked in place camera!

I've seen a 2D Minecraft video when I was small and it always sucked in my head. So I made this mod.

It was quite complicated, no up to date docs on how to make a world preset was avaliable, so I had to dig through a sea of old discord messages and experiment a ton to find out how.

Anyways Java is easy, it's just slow C++
